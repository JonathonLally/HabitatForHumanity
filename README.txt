Welcome to my final project for CSE248.  This is an inventory system for habitat for humanity.  
My program uses a mysql database that must be setup prior to use otherwise it won't have
any data or even users to login with.  

To setup mySql Server
1.Open mySQL Workbench and login to localhost. 
2.Go to root user account and change the password to "U3Z3aacoskOO55ndVAOf".
3.Go to File, Run SQL Script then navigate to filepath where my project is and then to
the sqldump directory should be a .sql file "sqldump".
4.Under default Schema name wrote "habitatsql" and then run.
